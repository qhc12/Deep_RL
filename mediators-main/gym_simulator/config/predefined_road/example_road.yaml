# Road files can be used to predefine the road, and can contain 3 parameters, defined below.
# Any subset of parameters can also be used (e.g. if only road is used, static_events and dynamic_events
# will still be randomly generated by the simulation environment)
# With the road parameter, you can set the consecutive road parts. This overrides the road generator.
# Each entry contains: [Road type (must be one of allowed_road_types in config file),
#                       length of road part (in km),
#                       OPTIONAL: speed limit at road part (if not specified, default is used)

# static_events defines the static_events on the road. If defined, overrides random static event

# dynamic_events are similar to static_events, defining the dynamic events on the road and
